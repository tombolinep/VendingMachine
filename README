About
==========================

	This repository contains a solution for to the Oracle Vending Machine Coding challenge.

	Specification:
	---------------

	You work for a firm which produces vending machines, currently for the UK market, and you are
	responsible for a new software component that tracks change (as in coins) within the vending
	machines.
	
	This component needs to provide APIs which:
	
	>  Initialise the vending machine to a known state, for use when the machine is set up. This
	should include setting the initial float (the coins placed in the machine for customer change)
	which should be accepted as a parameter.
	
	> Register coins that have been deposited by a user.
	
	> Produce a collection of coins that sum to a particular value (accepted as a parameter) from
	the coins available in the machine (for the purpose of returning change to the user) and
	remove the coins from the machine.

Design Considerations and discussion
======================================
	
	GBPCoin
	--------
	As per the requirements the currency for this vending machine is GBP Coins.
	There are 9 minted coins in GBP: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2 and £5.
	
	Given this information is it critical to protect the coin class to prevent invalid coins from being created.
	This will help protect against "bad" input into the vending machine itself.
	
	The necessary data the coin objects need to carry are: The name of the coin and the value of the coin.
	
	As such, the key point to discuss about the GBPCoin class is the constructor: 
	
	
	1) Protecting the GBPCoin constructor: 
	
		The coin can be instantiated with either the name of the coin or the value of the coin (in pence).#
		This provides some flexibility to the user for the interaction without being too restrictive. 
	
		An IllegalArgumentException is thrown (and caught) if:
			- the name of the coin is not currently minted (i.e. one of 9 above)
			- the value of the coin does not match a coin currently minted 	

		A mapping function is used for either constructor to ensure that only valid coins are instantiated, 
		e.g. a coin created with the name "10p" will automatically be assigned the value of 10. 




	Vending Machine 
	----------------
	
	As the main component of this solution and some ambiguity in the task specification, there are a few more items
	to discuss for the Vending Machine class. The Vending Machine class provides a constructor that sets the initial
	float (the starting coins), along with 4 critical methods. 
	
	1) Setting the initial float of the Vending Machine
	
		My Vending Machine objects take an int[] of the quantity of coins in order to create. The array must be 
		length of 9 so that a value for each minted coin is set. The indexes of the array related to a given coin
		rising in ascending order, with index 1 representing 1p coin, for example.


	2) Internal Data Model
	
		I chose to use a Map<String coinName, Integer quantity> for the internal Vending Machine model as this was the most
		intuitive data structure for keeping track of the coins and their quantity. The Map data structure provides O(1)
		complexity of insert, delete and access which is advantageous for the Vending Machine as the main functions are to
		deposit (insert), dispense (delete) as well as updating the user with the internal model (access).
		
		The Map type that I chose to use was a TreeMap as it improves the usability of the interactive portion of the 
		solution if the keys of all the Coins maintain a given order (ascending in value). This can be seen in the 
		console when the check function is used.  


	3) Protecting the constructor
	
		As with the GBPCoin class, the Vending Machine class constructor must also be protected to avoid any "bad" 
		initialisations and to maintain integrity and consistency of the internal data.
		
		As such, the instantiating int[] must contain a value for each coin as this provides a good tradeoff 
		between simplicity and control. It is preferable that the user provides all of the required information so
		that inferences are not necessary. If inferences were necessary then a great deal more validation of the 
		input would be required to maintain consistency of the internal data.

		The constructor will throw (and catch) an IllegalArgumentException if: 
		
		- The input int[] does not have a length of 9 (one index maps to one coin)
		- The input int[] contains a negative value 


	4) The deposit coin method
		
		The depositCoin method takes the name of the coin to deposit as an argument. This is then used 
		to create a GBPCoin object which is then 'inserted' into the internal Model. Strictly speaking the coin itself
		is not inserted into the model, the coin should already exist as a key in the model. However, it is advantageous
		to take advantages of the protection of the GBPCoin constructor to ensure that what is being deposited is a 
		valid GBP coin. Ultimately when the user calls deposit coin they create a GBPCoin which is checked for integrity
		and then the internal model map quantity for this coin is incremented if the coin is valid.
		
		
	5) The produce coins method
	
		The produceCoins method takes an input which is the value of the coins to dispense, if possible. 
		As this is the main algorithm of the data structure there are a few points to discuss here.
		
		Firstly, it is sensible for the  produceCoin method to take the value in pence because this is the simplest input
		that underlies each of the GBP coins. Using pence also eliminates the need to create multiple methods of conversion 
		for differing inputs (i.e. £1.50, 50p, £1 + 50p, 150 pennies etc). Moreover, given enough coins, it is possible 
		to create any amount of pence specified so no information is lost by taking the input as pence.
		
		Secondly, the input value is screened in order to optimise the algorithm by preventing unnecessary calculation if possible.
		The following scenarios will throw (and catch) an IllegalArgumentException against the input value given: 
		
			- The given target  a negative value
			- The target value exceeds the current funds available in the vending machine
		
		Thirdly, if the input value of the input is technically achievable from the value of the in the machine but the specific coins themselves
		are not, then a RunTimeException is thrown (and caught) after trying to calculate and dispense the coins from the machine. This logs
		a message to the user that the Vending Machine is not able to dispense the change.
		
		
	6) The produce coins calculation algorithm
	
		The actual algorithm used by the produceCoins method has a few notable points to discuss. The gist of the algorithm is to:
		Iterate over each coin in the model, starting with the largest first. If adding this coin does not exceed the target value, then
		add it and keep track of what coin we've added. Repeat this process for this particular type of coin until either the the quantity
		of the coin we have is 0 or that adding another of this coin would exceed the target value. If either one of these conditions are met,
		we immediately move onto the next coin in the sequence until all coins have been evaluated. The exception to this is if we have managed
		to reach our target, in which case the algorithm is immediately terminated with the coins required captured as data.
		
		Firstly, the algorithm makes use of the Map<Coin, Quantity> internal model of the data structure. This relies heavily upon the access
		Map method to interrogate the data. A design point I made here was to create a TreeMap, and this is also particularly advantageous in
		terms of time complexity for the algorithm because we can order the EntrySet of the map in descending order. This reverse operation
		results in O(n) in terms of time complexity, but as a result, larger coins are preferred by the algorithm. As a result this should
		reduce the number of iterations needed for over all other coins.
		
		Secondly, checks are used on each coin in the entry set before they are attempted to be added. If we don't have any (more) of the
		coin being evaluated then we don't try to add it. If adding the coin exceeds the target value then don't add it and move on to the next.
		If adding the coin will let us reach the target value then we store the coins and terminate the algorithm.
		
		
	7) Evaluating the algorithm (my best reasoning given my current understanding!) 
	
		Time complexity: 
		-----------------
	
		The prominent operations of the algorithm: 
		
			-	Reverse the entry set  -  O(n)
			-	Iterate over each element in the entry set  -  O(n)
			- 	Attempt to add the coin  -  O(1) due to accessing a Map
			-   Repeat n number of times depending on the coin quantity (in the worst case n times) 
		
		Overall Time complexity: 
			O(n) + O(n) + O(1) + O(n)  ->  O(3n + 1)  ->  O(n)
		
		
		Space Complexity 
		-----------------
		
		The prominent components: 
		
			- 	The coin quantity counter O(n)
			-   The entry set  O(n)
			-   The list to track which coins we've added  O(n)
		
		Overall Space complexity:
			O(n) + O(n) + O(n)  ->  O(n)
		
		
	8) Dispense coins 
		
		Taking the List of coins calculated from the producecoins method as an input, the dispense coins methods will iterate over each coin,
		accessing the coin in the map as a key and capturing the quantity via the value. A new value is put into the map on this key with a
		decrement of 1. The result is that the coins will have been dispensed (removed).
		Note that if the producecoins method does not conclude nominally (either an exception is thrown and caught or the number of coins are
		not sufficient, then no coins will be dispensed as a result.
		
		
	9) Interactive architecture  
	
		The interactive architecture is influenced by a very basic client-server model, where the Scanner is a pseudo server for taking user input.
		By controlling the user input in this sense it is possible to leverage the API designed so that methods are called appropriately without
		inhibiting usability of the program.
	


==============================================
The Vending Machine API (run via the Console)
==============================================

	The Vending Machine solution has 4 methods in the API: 
	
	
	1) deposit <coin_name>
	
		The deposit method adds a coin to the Vending Machine (simulating inserting a GBP coin).
		With interaction in mind, the user can specify the coin by name to deposit into the vending machine
		
		For example:
		
		deposit 10p    // deposits 10p into the vending machine and updates the internal funds
		deposit £1     // deposits £1 into the vending machine and updates the internal funds
		
	
	2) producecoins <value_in_pence>
		
		Using only the coins already in the Vending Machine, the producecoins method attempts to calculate the 
		coins to be dispensed from the Vending Machine that sum to given the value (which is specified in pence). 
		
		For example: 
		
		producecoins 100    // attempts to use available coins to dispense 100p (£1)
		producecoins 3050   // attempts to use available coins to dispense 3050p (£35.50)
	
	
	3) check
	
		Checks the Vending Machine's existing funds for each of the coins and also returns the total of the coins
		held in the machine.
		
		For example
		
		check  	// Produces a map<coin, quantity> of all valid coins currently in the machine 


	4) exit 
	
		Terminates the program
